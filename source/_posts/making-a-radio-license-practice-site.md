[RadioLisens.no](http://radiolisens.no/) (translates to RadioLicense) is an app/site to study for the Norwegian amateur radio license. It sources questions from previous exams and I hope to add more features like comments, pictures, and statistics in the future. It's built on react (Gatsby) and hosted statically. Source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jesper-Hustad/radio-license).

It's configured with PWA which stands for Progressive Web Application. This is a standard supported by Apple and Android which lets users "Add to Home Screen" your website. This makes it act just like an app for users which can now practice anywhere with no worries about mobile data. On a side note: Why companies still develop responsive websites, iPhone apps, and android apps when there is one simple solution that works for all three exists is beyond me.

## Motivation
After stumbling across the local amateur radio club at my university I jokingly asked about obtaining a license. A few weeks later I find myself in a 6 week amateur radio license course. If I pass the exam (and pay the government fee) I will be a fully certified HAM operator.  

The only problem? The previous year everyone failed the test. Unlike the US where there are 3 different license class privileges going from easy to hard (Technician, General, Amateur Extra) there is only one license type in Norway which gives you full privileges. I was really jumping in at the deep end.  

## Future plans  
Hopefully I pass the test. Then I can try playing around with some fun projects I have in mind.
